## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Extension is Active

2. **Right-click** on the `functions.json` file
3. You should see **"Split Functions by Schema"** in the context menu
4. Click it to split the file
5. Check that a `functions_split/` directory is created with separate schema files

### 3. Test Merge Back
1. Navigate to any file in the `functions_split/` directory
2. **Right-click** on any split file (e.g., `functions_public.json`)
3. You should see **"Merge Schema Files Back"** in the context menu
4. Click it to merge back to original `functions.json`

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

  - `functions_vault.json` (5 functions)

  - `functions_graphql_public.json` (1 function)
